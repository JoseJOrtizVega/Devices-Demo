# Devices-Demo
A demonstration project showcasing A demo showcasing a simple device system. A system meant to connect Receivers and Senders to create a chain of actions that allow for dynamic subscription and unsubscription of events sent by sender devices built in Unreal Engine 5.

## Features
- **Automatic Device Discovery**: Spatial volumes automatically detect and connect compatible devices within their boundaries
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular design using UE5 components for easy integration with any actor
- **ID-Based Matching**: Devices connect based on matching Device IDs, allowing for organized communication channels
- **Blueprint Integration**: Full Blueprint support with events, delegates, and callable functions
- **Safe Unregistration**: Thread-safe unregistration system with queue management during active operations
- **Interface-Driven Events**: Registration and unregistration events notify actors through a clean interface system
